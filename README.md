# MKS (www.mks-limited.ie)
A freelance bootstrap website for a client who focuses on doors, windows, insulation, and other general home services.

## Motivation
The purpose of the website is to promote these services and to provide a means of contacting the company.

## Features
The website is simple and clean. It includes interactive elements and smooth animations. It looks great on all screen sizes thanks to taking advantage of Bootstrap's Grid System, a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes. It uses a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

10 seconds after loading the website, a window shoes up on the bottom-right mimicking a WhatsApp message. The message can be closed, or clicked to re-direct the user to a WhatsApp conversation with the company owner.

The website has a secure contact form which sends an email to the company owner. The form offers both client-side validation of inputs, as-well as server-side validation (AWS API Gateway). The website prevents bots from flooding the form thanks to Google reCAPTCHA. If someone were to bypass the form and post to the API directly, therefore bypassing Google reCAPTCHA, an email would not be sent as Google reCAPTCHA is verified on the server-side again.

The website is encrypted with an SSL/TTL certificate generated by AWS Certificate Manager, giving the user peace of mind when sending data through the site. It does this by making sure that any data transferred between users and sites, or between two systems remain impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, preventing hackers from reading it as it is sent over the connection.

### Back-end
* The domain, **www.mks-limited.ie**, is registed on **AWS Route 53**.
* **AWS Route53** resolves to a suitable node on **AWS CloudFront**, Amazon's CDNs which are caching the website.
* **AWS CloudFront** updates its content from the site's files hosted on **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Solution)** every 24 hours.
* **AWS Certificate Manager** provisions a SSL/TLS certificate and deploys it to **AWS CloudFront** to provide the website's certificate.

* **Google reCAPTCHA v2** is used to verify the source of a form submission on both the client-side and the server-side.
  * If **Google reCAPTCHA** detects a human on the client-side, it will generate a token which is then forwarded alongside the form data to **AWS API Gateway**.

* **AWS API Gateway** checks that the data is matching the set JSON Schema. If so, it forwards the data to **AWS Lambda**.
* **AWS Lambda** uses the token generated by the user, as well as a secret key to make an API request to **Google's reCAPTCHA** API.
  * If the validation is successful, an email is sent using **AWS SES (Simple Email Service)**.
* The email is sent to **info@mks-limited.ie**, an email running on **AWS WorkMail**.
